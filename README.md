# Title: Interactive Rating Component Challenge - Styling Practice

## Description:
The Interactive Rating Component Challenge is a frontend mentor project that I discovered and undertook to improve my CSS and JavaScript skills through hands-on styling practice. This engaging challenge provided me with an opportunity to create a dynamic rating component while honing my ability to style web elements.

## Challenge Overview:
The main objective of this challenge was to develop an interactive rating component that allows users to provide ratings for a specific item or service. The challenge started with a basic HTML structure and minimal CSS layout, leaving room for me to implement the missing functionality using JavaScript.

## My Approach:
To tackle this challenge, I focused on the following requirements and guidelines:

- Displaying a set of buttons to represent the rating scale.
- Adding hover effects to highlight buttons up to the current mouse position.
- Enabling users to click on a button to select a rating.
- Updating the display to reflect the selected rating upon button click.
- Providing a visual indicator, such as changing the color of selected stars, for the current rating.
- Implementing a reset button to clear the selected rating and restore the component's initial state.
- Ensuring responsiveness and compatibility across various devices and screen sizes.
- Incorporating personal touches and additional enhancements to make the rating component more visually appealing and user-friendly.

## Getting Started:
 
- Analyzed the provided starter code, which included the HTML structure and basic CSS styles.
- Began implementing the missing functionality using CSS and JavaScript.
- Conducted thorough testing to ensure the rating component functioned as intended.
- Committed and pushed my changes to the repository.


**Optionally, I deployed the project to a live environment [interactive-rating-component-main](https://interactive-rating-component-main-pi-lyart.vercel.app/) to showcase my work.**
